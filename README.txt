The website name is School-Journal. It's a CAL (Computer Aided Learning) website, its' purpose is to help people, mainly in the educational sector to learn, teach and gather information about different subjects and topics they are interested in.
It is a work in progress and there are more features that will be added in the future. The website is written in PHP.

To run the website - install (preferably in C/ drive) and run XAMPP.
Go in the installed XAMPP folder, then in htdocs. In that folder place the scooljournal folder from GitHub
I have attached my database to the project inside assets folder. You can easely import it in phpadmin -  MySQL

This is one of my earliest websites I have worked on during my third year in university. It was a great way for me to learn how to build a website from end to end. There is a lot to improve in the code and I will do that sometime in the near future, however comparing it with my latest personal projects I have come a long way. The learning never stops.
