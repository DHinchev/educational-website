This is one of my earliest websites I have worked on during my third year in university.
School-Journal is a CAL (Computer Aided Learning) type of website, it helps people mainly in the educational
sector to learn, teach and gather information about different subjects and topics they are interested in.
It is a work in progress and there are more features that will be added.

To run the website - install (preferably in C/ drive) and run XAMPP.
Go in the installed XAMPP folder, then in htdocs. In that folder place the scooljournal folder from GitHub
I have attached my database to the project inside assets folder. You can easely import it in phpadmin -  MySQL
Instructions how to do it:
1)From localhost(127.0.0.1) go to phpmyadmin
2)Create new database called schooljournal and select it.
3)Then on the top of the page click on Import option.
4)Untick the option to allow the interuption of an import in the Partial import section.
5)From there click on "Choose File" and from there find schooljournal.sql located in the project folder - 
schooljournal/assets/schooljournal.sql and click Ok. Then on the bottom of the Import page click  Go.
6)The database should be uploaded now.
7)The tables should be located in the newly created schooljournal section.
8)Now you can log in the website and view it in here -  http://127.0.0.1/schooljournal/
